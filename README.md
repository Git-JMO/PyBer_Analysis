# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview / Purpose:
   * The purpose of this project was to give V. Isualize a written analysis of Pyber ride-sharing data and demonstrate how ride-sharing data differs by city type. In order to accomplish this, Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib were used to create a summary DataFrame and a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Analysis/Results:
  * Pyber Summary Data Frame:
    * As depicted in the table below, ride-sharing data such as the total fares and average fare per ride and driver are directly impacted by the amount of available drivers in each city type (Rural, Urban, Suburban). More specifically, as the amount of available drivers declines, the average fares per ride and driver increases. For instance, due to the limited amount of available drivers in rural cities where the population is expected to be lower, riders are forced to pay a higher fare and likely have to travel further to get to their destination. Converseley in urban cities, the high availability of drivers and an assumed larger population make it easy for rideshare access which in turn saves riders' money and increases the amount of total rides.

  * Multiple-line Graph (Total Weekly Fares vs City Type)
    * The multiple-line chart below clearly displays the difference of total weekly fares between city types.
